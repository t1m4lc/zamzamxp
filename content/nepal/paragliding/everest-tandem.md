# Paragliding in the Death Zone

This is it â€“ the world's most epic paragliding experience. Take off from above Everest Base Camp at over 5,000 meters and glide through the high Himalayas with Everest, Lhotse, and Ama Dablam surrounding you. Very few people on Earth have experienced this.

## The Ultimate Adventure

This isn't your typical paragliding trip. This is high-altitude, high-consequence flying requiring expert pilots and perfect conditions. We only fly when weather permits, and our pilots are among the most experienced high-altitude paraglider pilots in the world.

## The Experience

### Morning: Helicopter to Base Camp
Early morning helicopter flight from Kathmandu to the launch site above Everest Base Camp. The helicopter ride alone is spectacular!

### Preparation at Altitude
Your pilot will assess conditions and prepare equipment. You'll receive a thorough briefing. Take time to acclimatize and absorb the incredible surroundings.

### The Flight
When conditions are perfect, you'll launch into the thin mountain air. The flight typically lasts 15-30 minutes, gliding over glaciers and descending through the Khumbu Valley. The views are simply indescribable.

### Landing & Return
Land in the valley below and celebrate your achievement! Helicopter return to Kathmandu.

## Requirements

- Good physical health
- No serious altitude sensitivity
- Minimum age: 18 years
- Weight: 40-110 kg
- Clear weather conditions (we may reschedule if unsafe)

## Why This Is Special

Only a handful of companies offer high-altitude Everest paragliding, and even fewer do it safely. Our pilots have been flying these mountains for over a decade and know every wind pattern, every thermal, and every safe landing zone.

This is not for everyone. This is for adventurers who want to experience something truly extraordinary.

## Weather Dependent

Due to the extreme altitude and challenging conditions, this flight is heavily weather-dependent. We will only fly when conditions are safe. If we cancel due to weather, you'll receive a full refund or reschedule.

## Medical Requirements

You must be in good health with no heart or respiratory conditions. A medical clearance may be required. You should be comfortable with helicopter flights and high altitudes.
