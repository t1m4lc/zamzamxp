# Feel the Freedom of Flight

Experience the thrill of paragliding over one of the world's most beautiful valleys. Take off from Sarangkot hill and glide peacefully over Phewa Lake, the colorful city of Pokhara, and lush green hills – all with the mighty Annapurna range as your backdrop.

## Completely Safe & Beginner-Friendly

Never flown before? No problem! Our certified pilots have thousands of flights under their belts. You just sit back, relax, and enjoy the incredible views while your pilot handles everything.

## Itinerary

**Meeting Point**: Rendezvous at the communicated meeting point

**Transportation**: Board a minibus to the launch site at Sarangkot (1,592m) - approximately 30 minutes

**Preparation**: Safety briefing and equipment setup with your pilot. The takeoff is simple – just a few steps and you're airborne!

**Flight**: Soar peacefully over the valley for 30-45 minutes. Your pilot can make it calm and serene or add exciting acrobatic maneuvers if you're feeling adventurous.

**Landing**: Smooth landing at the lakeside area

**Photos & Videos**: Collection of your flight photos and videos

**Return**: Transportation back to the meeting point in Pokhara

## Flight Options

**Standard Flight (30 minutes)**: Perfect for first-timers. Smooth, scenic flight with beautiful views.

**Acrobatic Flight (30-45 minutes)**: For thrill-seekers! Includes spirals, wingovers, and other exciting maneuvers.

**Extended Flight (45-60 minutes)**: Longer flight time to catch thermals and maximize your time in the air.

## When to Fly

The best flying season is October through April when thermals are strong and skies are clear. Morning flights (9-11 AM) typically offer the smoothest conditions, while afternoon flights can be more dynamic.

## What to Bring

- Comfortable clothes (layers recommended)
- Sunglasses & sunscreen
- Camera or GoPro (if you want your own footage)
- Sense of adventure!

## Safety First

All our pilots are certified by the Nepal Airsports Association (NAA) and have extensive experience. We use modern, well-maintained equipment and never fly in unsafe conditions. Your safety is our top priority.
