# Feel the Freedom of Flight

Experience the thrill of paragliding over one of the world's most beautiful valleys. Take off from Sarangkot hill and glide peacefully over Phewa Lake, the colorful city of Pokhara, and lush green hills – all with the mighty Annapurna range as your backdrop.

## Completely Safe & Beginner-Friendly

Never flown before? No problem! Our certified pilots have thousands of flights under their belts. You just sit back, relax, and enjoy the incredible views while your pilot handles everything.

## What to Expect

### Before Flight
We'll pick you up from your hotel in Pokhara and drive 30 minutes to Sarangkot (1,592m). Your pilot will brief you on safety and what to expect. The takeoff is simple – just a few steps and you're airborne!

### During Flight
Once airborne, you'll soar peacefully over the valley. Your pilot can make it calm and serene or add some exciting acrobatic maneuvers if you're feeling adventurous. The views are absolutely breathtaking – Phewa Lake below, the Annapurna range ahead, and Pokhara city spreading out beneath you.

### Landing
Landing is smooth and easy on the lakeside area. After touchdown, you'll receive your photos and videos as a memento of your flight.

## Flight Options

**Standard Flight (30 minutes)**: Perfect for first-timers. Smooth, scenic flight with beautiful views.

**Acrobatic Flight (30-45 minutes)**: For thrill-seekers! Includes spirals, wingovers, and other exciting maneuvers.

**Extended Flight (45-60 minutes)**: Longer flight time to catch thermals and maximize your time in the air.

## When to Fly

The best flying season is October through April when thermals are strong and skies are clear. Morning flights (9-11 AM) typically offer the smoothest conditions, while afternoon flights can be more dynamic.

## What to Bring

- Comfortable clothes (layers recommended)
- Sunglasses & sunscreen
- Camera or GoPro (if you want your own footage)
- Sense of adventure!

## Safety First

All our pilots are certified by the Nepal Airsports Association (NAA) and have extensive experience. We use modern, well-maintained equipment and never fly in unsafe conditions. Your safety is our top priority.
