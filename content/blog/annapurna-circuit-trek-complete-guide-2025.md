## Difficulty Level and Physical Preparation

### What Does "Moderate to Difficult" Mean?

The Annapurna Circuit trek is classified as **moderate to difficult** for several reasons:

- **Long walking days:** 5 to 10 hours per day for 10-18 consecutive days
- **Significant elevation gain:** Cumulative ascents and descents of several thousand meters
- **High altitude:** Crossing Thorong La at 5,416 m requires gradual acclimatization
- **Variable conditions:** Changing weather, extreme temperatures at altitude
- **Technical trails:** Some passages are rocky and steep

### Physical Preparation Program

**3 months before departure:**

1. **Cardiovascular endurance:**
   - Running: 3-4 times per week (30-60 minutes)
   - Cycling or swimming: 2 times per week
   - Goal: be able to run 10 km without difficulty

2. **Strength training:**
   - Squats and lunges for legs
   - Core exercises for back and abs
   - 2-3 sessions per week

3. **Training hikes:**
   - Start with 4-5h hikes with elevation gain
   - Gradually increase up to 6-8h
   - Wear your backpack loaded (8-10 kg)
   - Favor varied terrain (uphill, downhill, rocks)

4. **Acclimatization:**
   - If possible, do a high-altitude hike before departure
   - Arrive a few days early in Kathmandu to adjust

### Preventing Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)

AMS is the main risk of the Annapurna trek. It can affect anyone, regardless of fitness level.

**Symptoms to watch for:**
- Persistent headaches
- Nausea and loss of appetite
- Dizziness and extreme fatigue
- Sleep disturbances
- Shortness of breath at rest

**Effective prevention:**

‚úÖ **Climb gradually**: Follow the "climb high, sleep low" rule - don't gain more than 500 m altitude per night above 3,000 m

‚úÖ **Acclimatization day in Manang**: NEVER skip this crucial step

‚úÖ **Hydration**: Drink 3-4 liters of water per day

‚úÖ **Walk slowly**: "Pole pole" (slowly in Nepali) - conserve your energy

‚úÖ **Avoid alcohol and tobacco** at altitude

‚úÖ **Preventive medication**: Diamox can be prescribed by your doctor (take 24h before ascending to altitude)

‚ö†Ô∏è **In case of severe symptoms**: Descend immediately! Descent is the only effective treatment.

### Why This Requirement?

The Nepalese government established this measure for several reasons:

1. **Trekker safety**: Reduction of accidents and acute mountain sickness cases thanks to local expertise
2. **Environmental protection**: Awareness and respect for protected areas

---

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Is wifi available on the trek?

Yes, most lodges offer wifi, but quality decreases with altitude. Expect 300-500 NPR (~$3-5) per hour or per day. Connection is often slow and unstable. Get local SIM cards (Ncell or NTC) to have data in low and medium altitude areas.

### What are the teahouses (lodges) like?

Teahouses are simple but functional accommodations. You'll have a private room with two beds and blankets (still bring your sleeping bag). Toilets and showers are generally shared. Central heating doesn't exist: a common room with a wood stove serves as a gathering place in the evening. The atmosphere is friendly and warm.

### Is it a dangerous trek?

The Annapurna Circuit trek is generally safe if you follow basic rules: gradual acclimatization, don't go alone in bad weather, be well equipped. Main risks are:
- Acute mountain sickness (prevention through acclimatization)
- Falls on slippery trails (trekking poles recommended)
- Hypothermia in case of storm (appropriate equipment)
- Avalanches at Thorong La (very rare, but follow local instructions)

Rescue helicopters can intervene in case of emergency (hence the importance of repatriation insurance).

### Can I do the trek solo?

‚ö†Ô∏è **No, since 2023, completely independent trekking is no longer allowed.** Nepalese regulations now require the presence of a certified guide to access the restricted Annapurna area.

However, this doesn't mean you must join a large group! You can:

‚úÖ **Private trek with guide**: You go alone or with your travel companions, accompanied by a dedicated guide. You keep all the freedom of pace and atmosphere.

‚úÖ **Small group**: Join a group of maximum 4-6 people to share the experience while benefiting from professional supervision.

**For solo female travelers:** Nepal remains a very safe destination. With a trusted guide like those from [ZamZam Xp](https://zamzamxp.com/nepal/trekking/annapurna-circuit), you benefit from enhanced security and respectful accompaniment.

### Do I need to book lodges in advance?

In low season (June-September, December-February), it's not necessary. In high season (March-May, October-November), it's recommended to book at least the lodge before Thorong La (Thorong Phedi or High Camp), as places are limited and demand is high. Your guide can handle this, otherwise ask the current lodge to call for you.

### What is the most difficult day?

Without a doubt, crossing **Thorong La Pass** (Day 10). You'll leave around 3-4 am to cross the pass at 5,416 m. Expect 8-10h of walking, including 3-4h of intense climbing in the dark, cold, and altitude. It's physically and mentally challenging, but reaching the pass and the panoramic view of the Himalayas are unforgettable.

### Can I rent equipment on site?

Yes, in Kathmandu and Pokhara, you'll find many trekking equipment rental shops (sleeping bag, down jacket, poles, backpack). Quality varies, check equipment condition carefully. Indicative rates: $2-3/day for a sleeping bag, $1-2/day for a down jacket.

### Do I need a visa for Nepal?

Yes, French nationals (and most nationalities) need a visa. It's easily obtained on arrival at Kathmandu airport (Visa on Arrival):
- 15 days: 30 USD
- 30 days: 50 USD
- 90 days: 125 USD

You can also apply for it online before departure (e-visa). Bring an ID photo.

### What is the time difference?

Nepal is at GMT+5h45. From France, that makes:
- +4h45 in winter time
- +3h45 in summer time

When it's 12 pm in Paris, it's 4:45 pm in Kathmandu.
