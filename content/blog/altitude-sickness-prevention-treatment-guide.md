## Understanding Altitude Sickness

**Altitude sickness**, also known as Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), affects trekkers ascending to high elevations where oxygen levels are lower. It can affect anyone regardless of fitness level, age, or previous high-altitude experience.

### Key Facts

| Fact | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Onset altitude** | Typically above 2,500m (8,200 ft) |
| **Affected population** | 25-50% of trekkers above 3,500m |
| **Risk factors** | Rapid ascent, poor hydration, overexertion |
| **Prevention** | Proper acclimatization, gradual ascent |
| **Treatment** | Rest, hydration, descent if severe |

---

## Types of Altitude Illness

### 1. Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)

The most common form, affecting up to 50% of trekkers above 4,000m.

| Symptom | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Headache | Primary symptom, often throbbing |
| Fatigue | Unusual tiredness, weakness |
| Nausea | Loss of appetite, queasiness |
| Dizziness | Lightheadedness, especially when standing |
| Sleep disturbance | Difficulty sleeping, waking frequently |

### 2. High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE)

Fluid accumulation in the lungs – **a medical emergency**.

| Symptom | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Breathlessness at rest | Can't catch breath even when still |
| Persistent cough | Often with pink/frothy sputum |
| Chest tightness | Pressure or gurgling sensation |
| Extreme fatigue | Unable to continue walking |
| Cyanosis | Blue lips or fingernails |

### 3. High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE)

Fluid accumulation in the brain – **life-threatening emergency**.

| Symptom | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Severe headache | Not relieved by medication |
| Confusion | Disorientation, irrational behavior |
| Ataxia | Loss of coordination, stumbling |
| Drowsiness | Extreme lethargy, hard to wake |
| Coma | In severe cases |

## Prevention Strategies

### The Golden Rules of Acclimatization

| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Climb high, sleep low** | Day hikes to higher elevations, return to sleep lower |
| **Gradual ascent** | Above 3,000m, gain no more than 300-500m sleeping altitude/day |
| **Rest days** | Every 3rd day or every 1,000m gained |
| **Stay hydrated** | 3-4 liters of water daily |
| **Avoid alcohol** | Dehydrates and masks symptoms |
| **Listen to your body** | Never ignore symptoms |

### Proper Acclimatization Schedule

| Altitude | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| **2,500-3,000m** | 1 night to adjust |
| **3,000-3,500m** | 2 nights, day hike higher |
| **3,500-4,000m** | Rest day after every 500m gain |
| **4,000-5,000m** | Rest day every 2-3 days |
| **Above 5,000m** | Minimize time, descend to sleep lower |

### Hydration Guidelines

| Factor | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| **Daily intake** | 3-4 liters minimum |
| **Urine color** | Should be light yellow |
| **Avoid** | Alcohol, excessive caffeine |
| **Include** | Electrolytes if sweating heavily |
| **Timing** | Drink consistently throughout day |

## Recognizing Symptoms

### Self-Assessment: Lake Louise Score

Rate yourself on each symptom (0-3 scale):

| Symptom | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---------|---|---|---|---|
| **Headache** | None | Mild | Moderate | Severe/incapacitating |
| **GI symptoms** | Good appetite | Poor appetite/nausea | Moderate nausea/vomiting | Severe nausea/vomiting |
| **Fatigue/weakness** | Not tired | Mild | Moderate | Severe |
| **Dizziness** | None | Mild | Moderate | Severe |
| **Sleep difficulty** | Slept well | Did not sleep as well | Woke many times | Could not sleep |

**Scoring:**
- **0-2:** Normal adjustment
- **3-5:** Mild AMS – rest, hydration, consider staying at altitude
- **6+:** Moderate/Severe AMS – do NOT ascend, consider descent

### Warning Signs Requiring Immediate Descent

🚨 **Descend immediately if you experience:**
- Ataxia (can't walk in a straight line)
- Altered mental state (confusion, unusual behavior)
- Breathlessness at rest
- Persistent severe headache despite medication
- Pink/frothy sputum when coughing

## Treatment Options

### Mild AMS Treatment

| Action | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Stop ascending** | Stay at current altitude |
| **Rest** | Light activity only |
| **Hydrate** | 3-4 liters water daily |
| **Pain relief** | Ibuprofen or paracetamol for headache |
| **Monitor** | Track symptoms using Lake Louise score |
| **Wait** | Usually improves in 24-48 hours |

### Medication Options

| Medication | Use | Dosage | Notes |
|------------|-----|--------|-------|
| **Acetazolamide (Diamox)** | Prevention & mild treatment | 125-250mg twice daily | Start 24h before ascent |
| **Dexamethasone** | Moderate-severe AMS/HACE | 4mg every 6 hours | Emergency use, prescription required |
| **Nifedipine** | HAPE treatment | 20mg slow-release | Emergency use, prescription required |
| **Ibuprofen** | Headache relief | 400-600mg as needed | Standard pain relief |

### Diamox (Acetazolamide)

| Aspect | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **How it works** | Speeds acclimatization by acidifying blood |
| **When to start** | 24 hours before ascending above 3,000m |
| **Standard dose** | 125mg twice daily (morning and evening) |
| **Side effects** | Tingling fingers/toes, increased urination, taste changes |
| **Contraindications** | Sulfa allergy |
| **Availability** | Prescription in most countries, OTC in Nepal |

## Emergency Protocols

### When to Descend

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Symptoms not improving after 24h rest | Descend 500-1,000m |
| Symptoms worsening | Immediate descent |
| Any HAPE/HACE symptoms | Emergency descent, minimum 1,000m |
| Ataxia (balance problems) | Emergency descent immediately |

### Emergency Descent Guidelines

1. **Don't wait until morning** – descend immediately if severe
2. **Descend at least 500-1,000m** or until symptoms improve
3. **Never leave someone with AMS alone**
4. **Use supplemental oxygen** if available
5. **Consider helicopter evacuation** for severe cases

### Emergency Resources on Popular Treks

|------|-------------------|
| **Everest region** | HRA clinic in Pheriche (4,371m), helicopter from Lukla |
| **Annapurna** | HRA clinic in Manang (3,519m), helicopter possible |
| **Langtang** | Basic health posts, helicopter from Kyanjin |
| **Manaslu** | Limited facilities, helicopter evacuation |

## Myths vs Facts

| Myth | Fact |
|------|------|
| "Fit people don't get AMS" | Fitness doesn't prevent AMS – anyone can be affected |
| "I was fine last time" | Previous experience doesn't guarantee immunity |
| "Diamox is cheating" | Diamox aids acclimatization, doesn't mask symptoms |
| "Push through the symptoms" | Never ascend with AMS symptoms |
| "Young people don't get AMS" | Age is not protective – possibly increases risk |
