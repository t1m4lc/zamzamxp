## When to Go Surfing in Essaouira?

The choice of period depends primarily on your level and goals:

- **For beginners (easy waves):** Period from **May to September**. The waves are smaller and less powerful, perfect for learning safely. The air temperature is also more pleasant, making the learning experience more comfortable.

- **For intermediate and advanced surfers (best waves):** Period from **September to April**. The Atlantic swell is more consistent and offers quality waves. This is when you'll enjoy the best conditions to progress and have fun on more technical waves.

- **For Kitesurfing and Windsurfing:** The wind is stronger from **March to October**, making Essaouira a world-renowned spot. The trade winds blow regularly, creating ideal conditions for sailing sports.

**Note:** The water requires wearing a wetsuit year-round. In summer, a 3/2mm wetsuit is sufficient, while in winter, a 4/3mm is recommended to stay comfortable in the water.

## The Best Surf Spots Around Essaouira

The Essaouira region is full of spots suitable for all levels. Here are the must-visit ones:

### Sidi Kaouki - The Essential Spot

**Level:** All levels

**Just 15 minutes from Essaouira airport** (and 25 km from the city), Sidi Kaouki is THE versatile spot par excellence and the surfers' favorite destination. **Closer to the airport than Essaouira city itself**, this authentic surfer village has managed to preserve its wild character and its atmosphere free from mass tourism.

### Essaouira Bay

**Level:** Beginner to intermediate

This protected beach break in the heart of the city offers gentle waves and a safe sandy bottom. Located directly in the city, it allows easy access to the beach on foot from the medina. Practical for those who want to combine surfing and cultural visits, but often windier and more crowded than Sidi Kaouki.

### La Grotte (Cap Sim)

**Level:** Advanced to expert

**The secret spot for experienced surfers!** Located towards Cap Sim, south of Sidi Kaouki, "La Grotte" is a legendary reef break offering world-class waves. Accessible after a short walk from Sidi Kaouki, this wild spot rewards those who venture there with powerful, hollow waves that break perfectly over a rocky bottom.

**Features:**
- High-quality barrel waves
- Works best with northwest swell
- Requires excellent technical mastery
- Spectacular natural setting with cliffs
- Preserved spot, uncrowded

⚠️ **Reserved for expert surfers**: rocky bottom, powerful currents, isolation. Only surf accompanied by a local who knows the conditions perfectly.

### Moulay Bouzerktoun

**Level:** Advanced

Located north of Essaouira, this spot is renowned for its demanding conditions. The waves are powerful, especially in strong wind, attracting experienced surfers and windsurfers. The wild beauty of the place amply compensates for the effort required to access it. Beware of currents and rocks, good experience is essential.

### Imsouane (day trip)

**Level:** Intermediate to advanced

About 80 km north of Essaouira, Imsouane is worth the detour for its mythical wave "The Bay", one of the longest right-hand waves in Morocco. In good conditions, you can surf for over a minute! The fishing village preserves a quiet and authentic atmosphere. A day trip from Essaouira is quite feasible.
