# Level Up Your Surfing

You can catch green waves, you can bottom turn, now it's time to surf Morocco's legendary point breaks. Anchor Point, Killer Point, Boilers â€“ these are the waves surfers dream about.

## What's Intermediate?

This camp is for surfers who:

- Can bottom turn and trim down the line
- Are comfortable in 3-6 foot waves

- Are ready for reef breaks and point breaks

## The Difference

Unlike beginner camps, we focus on:
- **Wave selection** - Picking the right waves and positioning
- **Advanced maneuvers** - Cutbacks, snaps, floaters
- **Barrel riding** - Reading and committing to tubes
- **Power surfing** - Generating speed and flow
- **Competition mindset** - Taking your surfing seriously

## Daily Program

## Epic Surf Spots

We chase the best waves based on swell and conditions:

**Anchor Point** - Morocco's most famous right-hand point break. Long, peeling barrels and endless walls. This is world-class.

**Killer Point** - Fast, hollow right. More challenging than Anchor but incredibly rewarding.

**Boilers** - Powerful reef break with serious barrels. For experienced surfers.

**Hash Point** - Long, performance wave perfect for practicing maneuvers.

**Mysteries** - Secret spot we'll take you to when conditions align.
